Python Playgroun  :-D

Here are some of the things I'd like to do:

* sampler code for various predictive methods on various data sets
  including a composite line graph showing differences of the 
  original data and the extrapolated values.  I would do statistics 
  about the effectiveness of models for a particular data set.
  However, I came to the realization last night that I do not have 
  a distributed system tucked away in my back pocket.  Therefore,
  I will so composite line graphs of the results of a single run.
  BUT, if anyone would like to grant me access to a distributed 
  system of some kind, I would be more than happy to run the needed
  tests and compose the desired statistics.  Until then, a line 
  graph it is.  I will be using various free time series data sets
  from DataMarket.com.

      * Models to be included
          * simple linear regression
          * ...


* sudoku generator

* pixel logic game

* more to come later.  Any suggestions?
